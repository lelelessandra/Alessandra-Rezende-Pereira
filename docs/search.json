I work with research in Fire Ecology, Protected Areas and Biodiversity Conservation and I am interested in community resilience and the influence of climate change on the landscape and fire regimes.\nI enjoy transforming scientific knowledge into accessible knowledge. I have expertise in scientific research and writing, combining ecological data analysis with clear communication, figures, and visual representations that translate complex information intuitively. I believe in teamwork as a path to generating richer and more innovative results.\nContact: alessandra.ecologia@gmail.com\n\n\nResearchGate · LinkedIn · X"

    "text": "Master’s degree in Forestry Sciences at the Federal University of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. My research focused on fire ecology. In the first chapter, I analyzed the direct impacts of fire on Brazilian vertebrates, using a citizen science database; this chapter was recently published in the Science of the Total Environment Journal. In the second chapter, I used the same methodology as the previous chapter, but to understand survival and indirect effects on animals. Finally, in the last chapter, I analyzed how burrows may represent an important evolutionary strategy for animals in the Brazilian Cerrado.\n\n\nSpecialization in Planning and Management of Protected Natural Areas at the Federal Institute of Southeast Minas Gerais (Brazil). For my final project, I researched socio-environmental conflicts in Brazilian Conservation Units and published the results in a national journal, aiming to foster dialogue and share experiences in conservation and management.\n\n\nIntern Environmental Education Program of the “Comuna do Ibitipoca / IbitiProjeto,” Minas Gerais, Brazil.\n\n\nConcluded my undergraduate degree with a final thesis on ethnoecology and the construction of popular knowledge about snakes in a rural community. In 2018, I presented and published abstract at the 16th Congress of the International Society of Ethnobiology. In 2024, I also participated in the publication of an article related to this research in the journal Biological Theory: Integrating Development, Evolution & Cognition.\n\n\nDuring my undergraduate program Participated in several research and outreach projects. First joined the reptile laboratory, where received a professional training fellowship from the UFJF Herpetological Collection (Reptiles).\nLater, I was awarded a scientific initiation fellowship for the project Temporal analysis of population structure, diet, and ethnobiology of a vulnerable freshwater turtle species, Hydromedusa maximiliani. In 2017, I presented and published an abstract of this research in the Proceedings of the 13th Brazilian Ecology Congress and the 3rd International Symposium of Ecology and Evolution. In 2020, I published a related article in the Ethnoscientia-Brazilian Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnoecology.\nI also worked as an environmental education monitor at the UFJF Botanical Garden; volunteered in the research project Environmental sustainability of the traditional extraction of Comanthera elegans (Bong.) L.R. Parra & Giul., a non-timber forest product from the surroundings of Sempre Vivas National Park; and held a scientific initiation fellowship in the project Ethnobotany and food sovereignty in the Dênis Gonçalves settlement, Zona da Mata Mineira: Reviving traditional food plants.\n\n\nBegan undergraduate studies in Biological Sciences Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF), Minas Gerais, Brazil."
