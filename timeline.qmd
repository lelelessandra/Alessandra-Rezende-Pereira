<strong>Master’s degree in Forestry Sciences</strong> at the Federal University of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. My research focused on fire ecology. In the first chapter, I analyzed the direct impacts of fire on Brazilian vertebrates, using a citizen science database; this chapter was recently published in the *Science of the Total Environment* Journal. In the second chapter, I used the same methodology as the previous chapter, but to understand survival and indirect effects on animals. Finally, in the last chapter, I analyzed how burrows may represent an important evolutionary strategy for animals in the Brazilian Cerrado.

<strong>Specialization in Planning and Management of Protected Natural Areas</strong> at the Federal Institute of Southeast Minas Gerais (Brazil). For my final project, I researched socio-environmental conflicts in Brazilian Conservation Units and published the results in a national journal, aiming to foster dialogue and share experiences in conservation and management.

<strong>Concluded my undergraduate</strong> degree with a final thesis on ethnoecology and the construction of popular knowledge about snakes in a rural community. In 2018, I presented and published abstract at the *16th Congress of the International Society of Ethnobiology*. In 2024, I also participated in the publication of an article related to this research in the journal *Biological Theory: Integrating Development, Evolution & Cognition*.

<strong>During my undergraduate program</strong> Participated in several research and outreach projects. First joined the reptile laboratory, where received a professional training fellowship from the UFJF Herpetological Collection (Reptiles).

Later, I was awarded a scientific initiation fellowship for the project *Temporal analysis of population structure, diet, and ethnobiology of a vulnerable freshwater turtle species, Hydromedusa maximiliani.* In 2017, I presented and published an abstract of this research in the Proceedings of the *13th Brazilian Ecology Congress and the 3rd International Symposium of Ecology and Evolution*. In 2020, I published a related article in the E*thnoscientia-Brazilian Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnoecology*.

I also worked as an environmental education monitor at the UFJF Botanical Garden; volunteered in the research project *Environmental sustainability of the traditional extraction of Comanthera elegans (Bong.) L.R. Parra & Giul., a non-timber forest product from the surroundings of Sempre Vivas National Park*; and held a scientific initiation fellowship in the project *Ethnobotany and food sovereignty in the Dênis Gonçalves settlement, Zona da Mata Mineira: Reviving traditional food plants.*
